Density Functional Theory (DFT) solver for 1-dimensional
systems.  
===============================

Installation (Linux)
------------

* Since we use fixed JAX versions (to prevent future non-compatibility issues), a python virtual environment is recommended. To install, use the following example command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pedersor/DFT_1d.git
$ cd DFT_1d
$ pip install .
```

Tutorial
------------
We recommend to first follow the tutorial in `examples/tutorial.py`.
