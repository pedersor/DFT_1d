Result data from various 1D systems. In `ions/` only atomic systems data is reported for various methods, e.g. HF, LDA, DMRG (essentially exact results), etc., with Z = 1, ..., 4 and N = 1, ..., 4 (resulting in 10 different atomic systems). In `molecules/` only DMRG results are reported for various 1D molecules. For each molecule, results are provided for various bond distances. The `molecules/relaxed_all/` directory contains results for equilibrium geometries of all the molecules tested.
